# random-bing-image
A small program that fetches a set amount of random images from Bing based on an inputted keyword. Made for "ryan"compo 7, an art (mainly music) contest held over at chipscompo.com.

'fetcher_manual.py' contains code for the main version, whilst 'fetcher.py' was an attempt on making it use fully random words, but it requires a Wordnik API key to work when built as an executable.
